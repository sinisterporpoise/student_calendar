# student_calendar
A simple, lightweight student assignment tracking calendar in Python

I started this last semester in Lazarus because I couldn't find a calendar that quite met my needs for keeping track of assignments that did not have a lot of extra features I did not want. The overall goal of this project is to let the user go back and forth between the dates of the calendar so he or she can see what assignments the user needs to have done by a certain date.

I have come close to finishing this, but I believe I'm going to be a little overwhelmed for the next few weeks to learn as much about Python as  I need to know. I'm particularly stuck on the file handling.

If anyone else thinks they can get this done, feel free to join in.
